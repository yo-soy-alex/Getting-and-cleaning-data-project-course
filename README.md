Peer-graded Assignment: Project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course

This repository represents Nunno Nugroho's submission for the Getting and Cleaning Data course project. It provides instructions for conducting an analysis on the Human Activity Recognition dataset.

Dataset:
Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones

Files:

CodeBook.md: This document serves as a code book, detailing the variables, the data, and any transformations or processes applied to clean the data.

run_analysis.R: This script executes the data preparation, following the five steps outlined in the course projectâ€™s definition:

Merging the training and test sets to create a consolidated dataset.
Extracting only the measurements related to the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Utilizing descriptive activity names to label the activities in the dataset.
Appropriately labeling the dataset with descriptive variable names.
Creating a second, independent tidy dataset from the dataset obtained in step 4. This new dataset includes the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
Final Output:
The exported result, FinalData.txt, represents the refined dataset after completing all the aforementioned steps.
